Hi! Thanks for checking my page out :]. This is a really simple recreation of the original breakout game. There's still much that needs to be added like levels, animation, and my own 
designs. I am currently taking some time to learn pixel art to touch up on those problems. 

The game:
- 3 Lives
- Each destruction of a brick increases the speed of the ball by 1.01 to 1.05
- Some bricks might grant power; however, there is no visual indicator on the bricks just yet. The powers are : expand paddle, faster paddle
- Red bricks need 3 hits; blue bricks take 2; green bricks only need 1 hit.



Thanks!
